/// One of the 128 Unicode characters from U+0000 through U+007F,
/// often known as the [ASCII] subset.
///
/// Officially, this is the first [block] in Unicode, _Basic Latin_.
/// For details, see the [*C0 Controls and Basic Latin*][chart] code chart.
///
/// This block was based on older 7-bit character code standards such as
/// ANSI X3.4-1977, ISO 646-1973, and [NIST FIPS 1-2].
///
/// **Note:** This is a polyfill for [`ascii::Char`][std::ascii::Char].
///
/// # When to use this
///
/// The main advantage of this subset is that it's always valid UTF-8.  As such,
/// the `&[ascii::Char]` -> `&str` conversion function (as well as other related
/// ones) are O(1): *no* runtime checks are needed.
///
/// If you're consuming strings, you should usually handle Unicode and thus
/// accept `str`s, not limit yourself to `ascii::Char`s.
///
/// However, certain formats are intentionally designed to produce ASCII-only
/// output in order to be 8-bit-clean.  In those cases, it can be simpler and
/// faster to generate `ascii::Char`s instead of dealing with the variable width
/// properties of general UTF-8 encoded strings, while still allowing the result
/// to be used freely with other Rust things that deal in general `str`s.
///
/// For example, a UUID library might offer a way to produce the string
/// representation of a UUID as an `[ascii::Char; 36]` to avoid memory
/// allocation yet still allow it to be used as UTF-8 via `as_str` without
/// paying for validation (or needing `unsafe` code) the way it would if it
/// were provided as a `[u8; 36]`.
///
/// # Layout
///
/// This type is guaranteed to have a size and alignment of 1 byte.
///
/// # Names
///
/// The variants on this type are [Unicode names][NamesList] of the characters
/// in upper camel case, with a few tweaks:
/// - For `<control>` characters, the primary alias name is used.
/// - `LATIN` is dropped, as this block has no non-latin letters.
/// - `LETTER` is dropped, as `CAPITAL`/`SMALL` suffices in this block.
/// - `DIGIT`s use a single digit rather than writing out `ZERO`, `ONE`, etc.

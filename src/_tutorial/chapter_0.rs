//! # Chapter 0: Introduction
//!
//! This tutorial assumes that you are:
//! - Already familiar with Rust
//! - Using `winnow` for the first time
//!
//! The focus will be on parsing in-memory strings (`&str`). Once done, you might want to check the
//! [Special Topics][_topic] for more specialized topics or examples.
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! `winnow` is a parser-combinator library. In other words, it gives you tools to define:
//! - "parsers", or functions that takes an input and gives back an output
//! - "combinators", or functions that take parsers and _combine_ them together!
//!
//! While "combinator" might be an unfamiliar word, you are likely using them in your rust code
//! today, like with the [`Iterator`] trait:
//! ```rust
//! let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! let even_count = data.iter()
//!     .copied()  // combinator
//!     .filter(|d| d % 2 == 0)  // combinator
//!     .count();  // combinator
//! ```
//!
//! Parser combinators are great because:
//!
//! - The parsers are small and easy to write
//! - The parsers components are easy to reuse (if they're general enough, please add them to winnow!)
//! - The parsers components are easy to test separately (unit tests and property-based tests)
//! - The parser combination code looks close to the grammar you would have written
//! - You can build partial parsers, specific to the data you need at the moment, and ignore the rest
